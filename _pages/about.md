# Think Open at Rovereto Workshop
## First edition - July 10-11 2020

I am part of the scientific organization of the first edition of [Think Open at Rovereto virtual Workshop](https://event.unitn.it/think-open).

The goal of Think Open Rovereto workshop is to bring together people from different disciplines and backgrounds to discuss the latest insights related to open science, with a special emphasis on cognitive neuroscience.
This year we individuated three main areas: replication and reproducibility; open access; standard ways to arrange, analyze and share neuroimaging data.
* [Registration](https://event.unitn.it/think-open/#registration) is free but mandatory until June 30th 2020. There are currently about 130 places still available.
* Follow the hashtag [#TORW2020](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TORW2020) on Twitter for news and insights about the program.
