I currently work as Open Data Technician for [CIMeC - Center for Mind / Brain Science at the University of Trento](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en/1025/open-science).

# Professional interests
## Open Science at CIMeC
[Think Open @ CIMeC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en/1025/open-science) is an initiative whose goal is to build, maintain and keep updated a virtual space, compliant with latest privacy and intellectual property rules, where researchers can share research products coming from every step of the research routine, i.e.: preliminary procedures and experimental setup, acquisition planning, data coming from healthy volunteers or patients, data analysis strategies and code, scientific publications.
## Italian Reproducibility Network
In 2021 I contributed to establish [ITRN - Italian Reproducibility Network](www.itrn.org) is a peer led consortium promoting, supporting and guarding Open Science practices in scientific research.
## Comunit√† Italiana dei Data Stewards
Since November 2023 I am an active member of the [Italian Data Steward community](https://open-science.it/en/-/data-steward-unite-breve-resoconto-del-kick-off-meeting-della-comunit%C3%A0-italiana-dei-data-steward). Its goal is, among the other things, to establish a shared virtual space for discussions and networking for research data managers professionals.
