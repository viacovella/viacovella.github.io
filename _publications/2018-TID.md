title: "Task-induced deactivation in diverse brain systems correlates with interindividual differences in distinct autonomic indices"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-TID
excerpt: 'In fMRI study, a continuous arithmetic task produced typical activation/deactivation patterns. We derived several autonomic (ANS) indices from cardiac and respiration data. Deactivation in different regions was predicted by different ANS indices. The findings can explain “failures to deactivate” in clinical and normative populations.'
